## 📊 Google Sheets Template

To use the Dream Parser Extension effectively, you need to structure your Google Sheets document in a specific way. We provide a template that you can use as a starting point:

[Download Template Spreadsheet](Sheets-example.xlsx)

The spreadsheet structure should be as follows:

- Sheet naming: Each sheet should be named in the format "MM.YY" (e.g., "03.24" for March 2024). This is crucial as the code uses this naming convention to fill in the correct month.
- Column A: Model names
- Row 1: Dates (from column B to AF, representing days 1-31)
- Cells till AF: Data cells where parsed information will be inserted

The extension's algorithm searches for model names in the leftmost column and dates in the first row, from the first cell to column AF. This structure is crucial for the correct functioning of the parser.

Important notes:

1. Make sure to create a new sheet for each month you want to track, following the "MM.YY" naming convention.
2. The extension will automatically identify the correct sheet based on the current date when parsing data.
3. If a sheet for the current month doesn't exist, the extension may not function correctly, so always ensure you have sheets prepared in advance.

## 📜 Usage

After installing and configuring the extension:

1. Click on the extension icon in Chrome to open the popup.
2. Log in to your Dream-Singles agency account.
3. Use the extension interface to initiate parsing and data management tasks.
4. Ensure your Google Sheet follows the provided template structure, including the correct sheet naming convention.
5. The parsed data will be automatically inserted into the corresponding cells in the appropriate month's sheet of your connected Google Sheet.
